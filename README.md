# COpenBLAS-Linux

`COpenBLAS-Linux` is a Swift package for Linux (Ubuntu) that allows you to link against [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS) library.

This package is a wrapper around [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS) so you have to install it before hand:

```
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
```
